            <br/>
            This blog has some unusual commenting guidelines. Please take a couple of minutes to read them! The goal of this blog is to teach people about programming & systems in a positive & friendly way and the comments have the same goal.<br/>
            <br/>
            I'm introducing a way to comment because I know there are a lot of knowledgeable and thoughtful people who read this blog and I'd like to hear more of what you have to say. <br/>
            <br/>
            I'm interested in discussions that are about learning new things (not arguing about who is "right" or "wrong"), so I decided to write down explicitly the kinds of comments I'd like to see.<br/>
            <br/>
            So! Here are the kinds of contributions I'd like:<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            new information about the subject of the post. Some examples of this include:<br/>
              * "you mentioned you're struggling to learn iptables, <link> really helped me learn iptables"<br/>
              * this post talked about how to use cgroups but not about how they work! How cgroups work is really interesting and here's how!<br/>
              * "you said you don't really know if X is useful. I use X all the time at work, here are some reasons I use it and why I like it!"<br/>
            <b>questions.</b> I think that great questions are just as important as new information. If a blog post brings up a question that you've always had but haven't been able to figure out, ask! Maybe we can make progress on it!<br/>
            <b>experience reports</b>. I think there's a lack of good stories about how people are using technology. If I write about some technology and you have a great story about your experience (eg "we wrote our own TCP stack and it [was harder than expected](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12021499)"), please share it!<br/>
            <b>corrections</b>. I often say things that are wrong on this blog. I'm generally more interested in substantial corrections than minor nitpicks. Don't be mean about it, obviously.<br/>
            <b>awesome links</b>. Links to other interesting reading that others may not have read is always appreciated. 
            <b>long replies</b>. I'm especially interested in replies that took you at least 5 minutes to write (more than off-the-cuff pithy comments, that's what Twitter is for :))<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            What's not appropriate:
            <br/>
            * opinions that aren't backed up by facts. I'm pretty interested in hearing about your **experiences** ("I used X and it was a bad experience because of A, B, and C"), but not so much unsubstantiated opinions ("X is terrible software and nobody should use it")<br/>
            * being rude or insulting.<br/>
            * comments that are funny but not informative<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
